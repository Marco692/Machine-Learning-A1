# Machine-Learning-A1
This topic is a comprehensive examination of the various types of classification algorithms and 
basic steps in supervised machine learning. The aim of the study is to build several different types 
of classifiers with different combinations of parameters, and select the best classifier of them to 
categorize 5000 grayscale images of the size 28 x 28 into 10 corresponding categories. Therefore, 
the two main processes of the study are data pre-processing and hyperparameters tuning. 
Specifically, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to perform dimensionality reduction 
on the dataset, while Grid Search and Cross Validation (GridSearchCV) are used to find the 
hyperparameters with the highest accuracy on the validation set among all the combinations.
